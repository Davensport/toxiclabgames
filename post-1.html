            <p>
                Hey everyone! I'm brand new to game development and I'm starting my first <em>real</em> 
                puzzle platformer I'm calling "Chroma-Shift."
            </p>
            <p>
                The main idea is a "Chroma-Shift" mechanic, where you can press <strong>Shift</strong> 
                to change your color (and the world's color) to solve puzzles.
            </p>
            <p>This week, I got the core mechanic working!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The player can shift from Blue to Red.</li>
                <li>When the player is Blue, they can stand on blue platforms and collect blue gems. Red platforms are faded and you fall right through.</li>
                <li>When the player is Red, the opposite is true!</li>
                <li>I also hooked up all the sound effects, music, and a main menu.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Big Bug... and The Fix!</h2>
            <p>
                I ran into a massive bug: If you were standing inside a "faded" platform and 
                pressed Shift, the platform would become solid <em>inside</em> you, and you'd get 
                permanently stuck.
            </p>
            <p>To fix it, I had to add a "safety check":</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I added an Area2D "bubble" around the player.</li>
                <li>Before shifting, the game checks if that bubble is overlapping an "inactive" platform.</li>
                <li>If it is, the shift is <strong><em>cancelled</em></strong>, and the game plays an error sound and flashes the player red to let them know it failed.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>It's a small detail, but it feels so much better and makes the game's "rules" feel clear.</p>
            <p>Here's the new, polished mechanic in action!</p>

            <p>
                It feels really solid now. Next up, I'm going to finish polishing Level 1 and 
                start designing Level 2.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
